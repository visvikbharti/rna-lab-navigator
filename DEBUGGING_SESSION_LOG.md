# Frontend Debugging Session Log

## Issue: Blank Page on Frontend

### Problem
The frontend was showing a completely blank page at http://localhost:5173/

### Root Cause
The main App component (`App.jsx`) had a naming conflict:
- The component was defined as `function MainApp()`
- But was being imported in `main.jsx` as `import App from './App.jsx'`
- This caused a JavaScript error: "Identifier 'App' has already been declared"

### Debugging Steps
1. **Verified React was working** - Created a simple test component that rendered successfully
2. **Checked for import errors** - The original App.jsx imported many components and contexts
3. **Identified the naming mismatch** - Component was `MainApp` but import expected `App`
4. **Found complex dependencies** - The full App used contexts (AnimationContext, DarkModeContext) that might have had issues

### Solution
Created a simplified `WorkingApp.jsx` that:
- Removed complex context providers temporarily
- Used direct imports only for essential components
- Gradually added features back
- Fixed the component export/import naming

### Lessons Learned
1. Always check browser console for JavaScript errors when page is blank
2. Component names must match their imports exactly
3. Start with minimal working version when debugging complex React apps
4. Complex context providers can cause silent failures if not properly initialized

### Current Status
- App is now working with core features
- Three modes: Search & Analyze, Hypothesis Mode, Protocol Builder
- Enhanced UI with particle effects
- All API endpoints connected and functional

### Additional Fixes
1. **Fixed Routing**: Added proper routes for all pages (showcase, upload, analytics, etc.)
2. **Fixed Navigation**: Added "Back to Lab" button on Colossal Showcase page
3. **Added Navigation Menu**: Added links to all sections in the header

### Known Issues to Fix
- Mode buttons (Hypothesis Mode, Protocol Builder) need to be clickable
- Only "Search & Analyze" is currently active by default
