# RNA Lab Navigator - Demo Guide for PI

## System Overview
**RNA Lab Navigator** is a private, retrieval-augmented assistant for your 21-member RNA biology lab that can answer protocol/thesis/paper questions with citations in <5 seconds, preserving institutional memory and accelerating experiments.

## Demo Queries for Each Mode

### 🔬 Mode 1: Search & Analyze (RAG Search)
*Purpose: Search through ingested lab documents (papers, thesis, protocols)*

#### ✅ Positive Control Queries (Should return good results):
1. **"What is the protocol for RNA extraction?"**
   - Expected: Detailed steps from TRIzol protocol with citations

2. **"Tell me about CRISPR-Cas9 applications in RNA editing"**
   - Expected: Information from 2024/2025 papers by Kumar, Sundaram, etc.

3. **"What did Rhythm Phutela investigate in her PhD thesis?"**
   - Expected: Details from the 2025 thesis about CRISPR, RNA modifications

4. **"Western blot protocol steps"**
   - Expected: Step-by-step protocol from general-western-blot-protocol.pdf

5. **"Who is Dr. Debojyoti Chakraborty?"**
   - Expected: Information about the PI from papers/thesis acknowledgments

#### ❌ Negative Control Queries (Should acknowledge lack of information):
1. **"What is the weather today?"**
   - Expected: "I don't have information about weather..."

2. **"Tell me about quantum computing"**
   - Expected: "I don't have enough information about quantum computing..."

3. **"Recipe for chocolate cake"**
   - Expected: System should recognize this is off-topic

### 🧪 Mode 2: Hypothesis Mode
*Purpose: Explore "what if" scenarios with AI-powered scientific reasoning*

#### ✅ Good Hypothesis Queries:
1. **"What if we could use CRISPR to edit RNA directly without affecting DNA?"**
   - Expected: Detailed analysis with scientific basis, feasibility assessment, recommended experiments

2. **"What if we developed a reversible RNA modification system for temporal gene control?"**
   - Expected: Exploration of possibilities, challenges, related research directions

3. **"What if we combined RNA interference with CRISPR for enhanced specificity?"**
   - Expected: Scientific reasoning about dual-system approaches

4. **"What if we could visualize RNA modifications in real-time in living cells?"**
   - Expected: Discussion of imaging techniques, fluorescent markers, challenges

#### ❌ Poor Hypothesis Queries (Should handle gracefully):
1. **"What if RNA was made of chocolate?"**
   - Expected: Low confidence score, redirection to scientific discussion

2. **"Can we make humans immortal with RNA?"**
   - Expected: Ethical considerations, scientific limitations discussed

---

### 📋 Mode 3: Protocol Builder
*Purpose: Generate custom lab protocols based on requirements*

#### ✅ Good Protocol Requests:
1. **"Generate a protocol for RNA extraction from mammalian cells"**
   - Expected: Complete protocol with materials, steps, safety warnings

2. **"Create a protocol for qPCR analysis of gene expression"**
   - Expected: Detailed qPCR protocol with primer design considerations

3. **"I need a protocol for CRISPR guide RNA design and validation"**
   - Expected: Step-by-step gRNA design protocol

4. **"Protocol for purifying His-tagged proteins"**
   - Expected: Ni-NTA purification protocol based on roche-ninta-protocol.pdf

#### ❌ Edge Cases (Should handle appropriately):
1. **"Make me a protocol for time travel"**
   - Expected: Error message or redirection to valid protocols

2. **"Protocol without any details"**
   - Expected: Request for more specific requirements
