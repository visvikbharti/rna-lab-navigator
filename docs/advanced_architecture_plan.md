## 2. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Retrieval & Performance (Sprint 3)
1. **Hybrid Search Implementation**
   - Enable Weaviate hybrid search with weights: 0.75 vector, 0.25 BM25
   - Benchmark against 20 test queries, targeting 15% NDCG improvement
   - Add `hybridMode` parameter to `/api/query/` endpoint

2. **Streaming Responses**
   - Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) in Django view
   - Add streaming consumer in React with proper loading states
   - Ensure citation formatting works with streamed text

3. **Embedding Caching System**
   - Implement SHA-256 caching with Redis for embedding vectors
   - Add TTL of 30 days for cached embeddings
   - Create admin command to rebuild cache from scratch if needed

### Phase 2: User Feedback & Quality (Sprint 4)
1. **Feedback Collection System**
   - Add Feedback model in Django with query, rating, and comment fields
   - Implement üëç/üëé buttons in AnswerCard component
   - Create admin dashboard for feedback analysis

2. **Cross-Encoder Improvement Pipeline**
   - Build dataset generation from user feedback
   - Create fine-tuning script for cross-encoder using collected data
   - Implement weekly retraining scheduler via Celery

3. **Tiered Model Selection**
   - Implement query complexity analyzer (token count, syntax complexity)
   - Create routing logic for simple/complex queries
   - Add configuration for model selection thresholds

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Sprint 5+)
1. **Figure Extraction Pipeline**
   - Extract figures and captions during PDF ingestion
   - Store thumbnails and reference in vector DB
   - Implement frontend display of relevant figures

2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Define entity schema (Gene, Protein, Assay, Reagent, etc.)
   - Extract entities during document ingestion
   - Implement Neo4j storage and query integration

3. **Local Model Fallback**
   - Set up Ollama with Mistral or Llama model
   - Implement fallback logic with circuit breaker pattern
   - Create model quality comparator for query routing

## 3. Success Metrics
- **Retrieval Quality**: 25% improvement in NDCG@10 over baseline
- **Cost Efficiency**: 50% reduction in OpenAI API costs
- **User Satisfaction**: 80%+ positive feedback rate
- **System Resilience**: 99.9% uptime, even during OpenAI outages
- **Response Time**: 95% of queries answered within 3 seconds (perceived time)

## 4. Implementation Timeline
- **Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Hybrid search, streaming, embedding cache
- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Feedback system, reranker improvements, tiered models
- **Sprint 5 (Weeks 9-10)**: Figure extraction, knowledge graph foundations
- **Sprint 6+ (Beyond)**: Multi-modal support, local model integration, notebook plugins

## 5. Technical Debt Management
Throughout implementation, we'll maintain code quality by:
- Writing tests for all new features (target: 80%+ coverage)
- Documenting architecture decisions in ADRs
- Refactoring existing code when adding new capabilities
- Keeping dependencies updated with security patches
- Running regular performance profiling

This enhancement plan balances immediate wins (hybrid search, streaming) with longer-term strategic improvements (knowledge graph, local models) to create a more robust, efficient, and feature-rich system while maintaining the core simplicity that makes RNA Lab Navigator valuable.
