   - Command injection
   - XML/JSON injection
   - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

2. **Data Security**:
   - Data encryption validation
   - PII handling
   - Injection into RAG pipeline
   - Vector database security

#### Track 3: API & Integration Security

1. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting effectiveness
   - Parameter tampering
   - Broken function level authorization
   - Input validation bypass

2. **External Integration Security**:
   - OpenAI API key management
   - Request/response validation
   - Prompt injection attacks

#### Track 4: Infrastructure & Network

1. **Infrastructure Security**:
   - Docker configuration review
   - Secrets management
   - Environment variable exposure
   - Dependency analysis

2. **Network Security**:
   - TLS implementation
   - Network isolation effectiveness
   - mTLS implementation for Weaviate
   - Security header implementation

### Testing Tools

1. **Scanning Tools**:
   - OWASP ZAP
   - Burp Suite Professional
   - SQLmap
   - Nikto

2. **Manual Testing Tools**:
   - Postman/Insomnia
   - JWT-tool
   - FFUF
   - Custom Python scripts

## 3. Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Discovery (Days 1-2)

- Map all API endpoints
- Identify authentication mechanisms
- Discover input parameters
- Document application flow
- Develop testing strategy

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (Days 3-5)

- Automated scanning
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
- Input validation testing

### Phase 3: Manual Testing & Exploitation (Days 6-8)

- Business logic flaws
- Advanced authentication attacks
- Custom exploitation attempts
- LLM-specific attacks (prompt injection, data extraction)

### Phase 4: Reporting & Validation (Days 9-10)

- Vulnerability documentation
- Risk assessment
- Remediation recommendations
- Evidence collection
- Report generation

## 4. Deliverables

1. **Penetration Testing Report**:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed findings with severity ratings
   - Step-by-step reproduction guides
   - Evidence (screenshots, request/response data)
   - Remediation recommendations
   - Risk assessment

2. **Remediation Validation**:
   - Post-fix validation testing
   - Verification of security fixes

## 5. Risk Rating Methodology

Vulnerabilities will be rated using the CVSS v3.1 scoring system and categorized as:

- **Critical** (CVSS 9.0-10.0): Immediate action required
- **High** (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Prioritize remediation
- **Medium** (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Plan for remediation
- **Low** (CVSS 0.1-3.9): Address as resources permit
- **Informational**: Best practice recommendations

## 6. Specific Test Cases

### Authentication & Authorization

1. Test JWT token implementation:
   - Check for proper signing
   - Verify expiration is enforced
   - Test for token replay attacks
   - Validate signature algorithm security

2. Test role-based access:
   - Attempt to access admin endpoints as regular user
   - Modify user roles in requests
   - Test object-level permissions

### Data Security

1. Test for SQL injection:
   - Query parameter manipulation
   - Form field injection attempts
   - JSON parameter injection

2. Test for XSS vulnerabilities:
   - Stored XSS in user input fields
   - Reflected XSS in search parameters
   - DOM-based XSS in React components

3. LLM-specific tests:
   - Prompt injection attacks
   - Attempts to extract training data
   - Unauthorized access to documents via search

### API Security

1. Test rate limiting:
   - Rapid request sequences
   - Distributed request patterns
   - Rate limit bypass techniques

2. Test WAF implementation:
   - Common attack signature testing
   - WAF bypass techniques
   - False positive assessment

### Network Security

1. Test mTLS implementation:
   - Certificate validation
   - Expired certificate handling
   - Certificate revocation testing

2. Test network isolation:
   - Verify no external LLM calls when in isolated mode
   - Validate data containment

## 7. Testing Schedule

| Day | Activities |
|-----|------------|
| 1-2 | Reconnaissance, environment setup, planning |
| 3-5 | Automated scanning, authentication testing |
| 6-8 | Manual exploitation, business logic testing |
| 9-10 | Report preparation, validation, presentation |

## 8. Security Test Environment

- **Test Environment**: Stage/UAT deployment with sanitized test data
- **Test Accounts**: Admin, Lab Manager, Researcher, and Guest roles
- **Test Data**: Non-sensitive documents with similar structure to production

## 9. Communication Plan

- **Kick-off Meeting**: Scope finalization, rules of engagement
- **Daily Updates**: Brief status reports on testing progress
- **Critical Findings**: Immediate notification for critical vulnerabilities
- **Final Report Delivery**: Presentation and walkthrough of findings

## 10. Legal Considerations

- Testing conducted only with explicit authorization
- No disruption to production services
- No exfiltration of sensitive data
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations
