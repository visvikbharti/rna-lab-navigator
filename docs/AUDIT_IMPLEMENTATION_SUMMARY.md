- Scheduled Celery tasks for periodic aggregation
- Data retention policies for managing storage

### 4. System Monitoring

- `SystemMonitor`: Checks component health and collects metrics
- Background monitoring thread for continuous health checks
- `monitor_system` management command for manual operation

### 5. Visualization Components

- Admin dashboard with interactive charts
- System health overview panel
- Query analytics visualizations
- Custom admin views for metrics data

### 6. Real-time Updates

- WebSocket consumers for live metrics
- Channel layer integration for broadcasting updates
- Client-side code for displaying real-time data

## Integration Points

The analytics system is integrated with:

1. **Core Request Pipeline**: via `AnalyticsMiddleware`
2. **Query Processing**: via decorators and hooks in `views.py`
3. **Vector Search**: via instrumentation in `embeddings_utils.py`
4. **LLM Generation**: via timing and metrics in query processing
5. **Django Admin**: via custom admin views and templates
6. **Scheduled Tasks**: via Celery beat configuration

## Configuration

The system is configured through the following settings in `settings.py`:

```python
# Analytics settings
ANALYTICS_ENABLED = True
ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS = 90
ANALYTICS_MONITOR_SYSTEM = True
ANALYTICS_SENSITIVE_PATHS = ['/admin/', '/api/auth/', '/api/users/']
```

## Scheduled Tasks

The following Celery tasks are configured:

- `aggregate_daily_metrics`: Daily metrics aggregation (1 AM)
- `generate_weekly_report`: Weekly summary report (Monday 1:30 AM)
- `monitor_system_performance`: System monitoring (every 15 minutes)
- `cleanup_old_metrics`: Data retention management (monthly)

## Usage Examples

### Accessing the Dashboard

Admin users can access the dashboard at:
```
/admin/api/analytics/dailymetricaggregate/dashboard/
```

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `api/analytics/dashboard/data/`: Dashboard summary data
- `api/analytics/system/health/`: System health metrics
- `api/analytics/queries/analytics/`: Query pattern analytics
- `api/analytics/security/analytics/`: Security event analytics

### WebSocket Connections

Real-time metrics are available via WebSocket at:

- `ws/analytics/metrics/`: System metrics stream
- `ws/analytics/events/`: Security and audit events stream

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Database Growth**: Monitor the size of analytics tables and adjust retention settings as needed
2. **Performance Impact**: Watch for any performance impact from data collection
3. **New Components**: When adding new components, update health monitoring checks
4. **New Metrics**: Add new metric types to the aggregation system as needed

## Future Work

Several enhancements could be considered for future development:

1. **Advanced Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning for identifying unusual patterns
2. **Alert System**: Configurable alerts and notifications for critical events
3. **Export Capabilities**: Report generation in various formats
4. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
5. **Mobile Interface**: Mobile-friendly views for on-the-go monitoring

## Conclusion

The Audit Dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into the RNA Lab Navigator system, supporting operational monitoring, security compliance, and performance optimization. With real-time metrics, aggregated reporting, and detailed event tracking, administrators can ensure the system operates optimally while maintaining security and compliance.
