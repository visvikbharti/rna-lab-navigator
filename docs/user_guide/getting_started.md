## Example Queries

Here are some examples of effective queries:

- "What's the protocol for RNA extraction using TRIzol?"
- "What concentration of dNTPs should I use for RT-PCR?"
- "What troubleshooting steps should I follow if my Western blot has high background?"
- "What did Phutela's thesis conclude about rhythm regulation in RNA processing?"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - Include relevant details in your question.
2. **Use technical terminology** - The system understands scientific terms.
3. **Mention techniques or methods** - If you're looking for a specific protocol or technique, mention it by name.
4. **Ask one question at a time** - For complex inquiries, break them down into separate questions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No relevant results**: Try rephrasing your question or using different technical terms.
- **Slow response time**: Check your network connection or try again later during off-peak hours.
- **Missing documents**: Contact your lab administrator to request ingestion of specific resources.
