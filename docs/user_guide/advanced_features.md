## Advanced Search Techniques

### Query Syntax

RNA Lab Navigator supports advanced search syntax to help you find exactly what you need:

- **Phrase searching**: Use quotes around phrases to search for exact matches, e.g., "RNA polymerase II"
- **Boolean operators**: Use AND, OR, and NOT to create complex queries, e.g., CRISPR AND Cas9 NOT dCas9
- **Field-specific search**: Target specific document properties using field prefixes:
  - `author:Kumar` - Search for documents by author
  - `year:2024` - Search for documents from a specific year
  - `type:protocol` - Limit search to a specific document type

### Citation Context

When viewing results, you can:

1. Click on any citation to jump directly to that reference
2. See the specific context surrounding the cited information
3. Navigate through highlighted sections that contain relevant information

## Document Management
