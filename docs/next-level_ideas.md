Here are a handful of ‚Äúnext-level‚Äù ideas you can keep in the parking lot.  None are critical for the MVP, but each can add real leverage once the core system is stable.

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Evaluation & QA**              | ‚Ä¢ Automated weekly eval script that re-runs a saved test bank and emails a scorecard (precision, recall, avg-confidence).<br>‚Ä¢ Diff alert if accuracy drops ‚â• 10 %. | Catch silent regressions (e.g., model upgrade, bad ingest) before users complain.                                 | ¬Ω day                                  |
| **User feedback loop**           | Thumbs-up/-down buttons + optional ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù text box ‚Üí logs to `Feedback` table ‚Üí nightly dashboard.                                                         | Turns Navigator into a self-improving system; data for prompt/embedding tuning.                                   | 1‚Äì2 days                               |
| **Hybrid retrieval**             | Combine BM25 keyword scores (ElasticSearch) with vector similarity; let cross-encoder rerank the merged list.                                                       | Best of both worlds: props up edge cases like exact primer names or catalogue IDs.                                | 2‚Äì3 days                               |
| **Lightweight on-prem LLM**      | Add a vLLM server running Mistral-7B-Q4\_K\_M. Route low-stakes or high-volume queries there; fall back to GPT-4o when confidence is low.                           | Cuts OpenAI cost by 50-70 % while preserving quality for hard questions.                                          | 3‚Äì4 days + GPU                         |
| **Knowledge-graph view**         | Auto-create nodes (Gene, Assay, Reagent) + edges (‚Äúused\_in‚Äù, ‚Äútargets‚Äù) from extraction scripts; allow graph-based RAG (Weaviate KG or Neo4j).                     | Enables multi-hop questions: ‚ÄúWhich antibodies have been used with Cas13 experiments that also involve lncRNA X?‚Äù | 1 week prototype                       |
| **Daily digest bot**             | Slack / Teams message at 9 AM IST: ‚Äú3 new Cas13 preprints yesterday‚Äù with abstracts + links; ‚Äú2 protocols updated‚Äù.                                                 | Keeps lab engaged without opening the app.                                                                        | ¬Ω day                                  |
| **Inline figure retrieval**      | Store thumbnails of thesis / paper figures; when answer cites ‚ÄúFig 3B‚Äù, frontend shows the image beside text.                                                       | Huge UX win for newcomers trying to visualise results.                                                            | 2‚Äì3 days (store base64 or signed URLs) |
| **Voice interface (bench mode)** | Simple Web Speech API in frontend: ask via mic; answer read aloud. Eliminates gloves-off typing at the bench.                                                       | Accessibility + wow factor.                                                                                       | 1‚Äì2 days                               |
| **Experiment notebook plugin**   | VS Code / JupyterLab extension that lets users highlight text and ‚ÄúSend to Navigator‚Äù for immediate context or citations.                                           | Integrates into real-time analysis workflow.                                                                      | 1 week                                 |

### Strategic suggestion

1. **Stabilize MVP** ‚ûú 2. **Gather user feedback & metrics** ‚ûú 3. **Pick the single enhancement that removes the most friction** (usually hybrid retrieval or feedback loop).
   Avoid piling on features until confidence in day-to-day reliability is 95 %+.

### Personal tip

Keep a tiny `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root.  Every time you tweak chunk size, prompt, or dependencies, write one sentence.  Future-you (and contributors) will love that paper trail.

I‚Äôll leave you with the mantra that guides most successful internal AI tools:

> **‚ÄúSmall surface, sharp focus, steady improvement.‚Äù**

Finish the essentials, let colleagues experience the benefit, then grow only what solves the next most painful bottleneck.  That path almost always wins over the ‚Äúeverything at once‚Äù approach.

Good luck‚Äîping me anytime you‚Äôre ready for the next leap!
